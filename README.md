Various decently supported Web API examples, developed with help from Gemini :)

The goal is to learn from these examples, become familiar at integrating different apis (for example, the Background Sync API and IndexedDB would be great for a messaging feature... or form submission). This repository is for learning only...if you're reading this, hey :)
